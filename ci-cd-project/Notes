# for RedHat/RedHat, you should start and enable the installed services first. Using Conditionals: -

# - name: Ensure apache is running
#      service:
#        name: httpd
#        state: started
#        enabled: true
#    when: ansible_facts['ansible_distribution'] == "RedHat"

# started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.

# Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied - 
# multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

# file module: -
# - name: Remove file (delete file)
#   file:
#     path: /etc/foo.txt
#     state: absent

# Diff name of apache for installing apache on Ubuntu & RedHat: -

# for Ubuntu/Debian --> sudo apt install apache2 -y
# for RedHat --> sudo yum install httpd -y
# Hence, use conditionals
