# for RedHat, you should start and enable the installed services first. Using Conditionals: -

# - name: start & enable httpd
#      service:
#        name: httpd
#        state: started
#        enabled: true
#    when: ansible_facts['ansible_distribution'] == "RedHat"

# started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.  ************************
