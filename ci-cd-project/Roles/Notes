By default, Ansible looks for roles in the following locations:

1)    in collections, if you are using them
2)    in a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file
3)    in the configured roles_path. The default search path is ~/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles.
4)    in the directory where the playbook file is located

choose either 2) or 4)
