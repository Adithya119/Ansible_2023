# In Tomcat-2, we are upgrading tomcat to 10.1.8 version by modifying only the groupvars/webservers file

# In Tomcat-2, we have introduced vars --> check "group_vars" folder

# Also, moved daemon-reload from handlers to normal tasks (included state: started inside this task).

# Tested meta module's flush_handlers option

# group_vars & host_vars folders are standard folder structure of Ansible, to store variables.

# Command for changing what latest points to:-
  ln -sfn /a/new/path files  
    Note:- the "create symbolic link latest" task works like a charm.
