With Jinja templates, you can delete tomcat.service & tomcast.service-centos files & create just 1 new file "tomcat.service.j2" (for both ubuntu & centos/redhat vm's) under templates folder.

Name of jinja files can be of your choice but should have .j2 extension

# Look into notes for the whole point of why we used Jinja templating.
