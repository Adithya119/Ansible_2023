# Easiest way to give execute permissions is: -

# You can also directly give command:-
"command" is a module
    command: sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/tomcat/latest/bin/*.sh'


# you should notify systemd whenever you add a unit file --> # sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ex: /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service


# the file tomcat-users.xml is an existing file, hence I have used blockinfile module to add content to it.

# the files manager-context.xml & host-manager-context.xml are already created by the system, hence I have used lineinfile module - 
# to just replace the line I want.
