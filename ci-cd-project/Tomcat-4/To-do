Question:- 
1) should the groupname inside hosts file (ex:- webubuntu) & the folder name under group_vars (ex:- webubuntu) match, for ansible to select appropriate vars?
A) Absolutely Yes!

Explaination:
---
hosts file:-
    [webubuntu]
    172.31.38.155

    [webredhat]
    172.31.45.220
     

group_vars folder:- 
    "webubuntu" folder:-
        java_package: openjdk-11-jdk
        tomcat_minor_version: '9.0.78'
        tomcat_major_version: '9'

    "webredhat" folder:-
        java_package: java-11-openjdk-devel
        tomcat_minor_version: '10.1.11'
        tomcat_major_version: '10'

# 
# 1) Ansible control node reads tomcat.yml => 
# 2) it picks to work on '172.31.38.155' (orderly fasion) & it comes across it's 1st task (install java) & sees this variable    -      "{{ java_package }}" => it needs to look for the value of this variable & notices that there are only group_vars defined in the current directory & no specific host_vars & then notices that this ip '172.31.38.155' is 'grouped' under [webubuntu] of hosts file.
# 3) Hence, it pulls the value of this variable from 'webubuntu' file under group_vars folder

# 4) with the similar logic, for ip '172.31.45.220', it pulls the var from 'webredhat' file under group_vars folder

# 5) But if you had written a 'host_vars/172.31.38.155' file, then values in host_vars will be given precedence over the values mentioned in 'group_vars/webubuntu'. That's how priority works.
