Ansible looks for and loads all of these files in order:

group_vars/all.yml       # .yml extension is optional
group_vars/<group.yml>
host_vars/<hostname.yml>

# The contents of the files are merged together. This allows the 'group.yml' files to override the 'all.yml' file, and for the 'hostname.yml' file to override both of them.

Folder structure of roles:

├── group_vars                  # group_vars folder. # you can also have host_vars folder. 
├── hosts                       # inv file
├── tomcat-role-2               # role folder
├── tomcat.yml                  # playbook

# Lamp-stack:-

I have ran installed Lamp stack on both Ubuntu & Redhat servers using Lamp-stack role. I have checked the installation is successful by browsing the below:

http://<publicip>

Installing lamp is not interfering with tomcat installation. Tomcat still runs on both servers & is accessible via http://<publicip>:8080
