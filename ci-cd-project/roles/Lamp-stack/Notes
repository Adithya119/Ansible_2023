# In Lamp-stack, we have used group_vars/all, group_vars/db_1, group_vars/db_2 & hosts-3 files

# In Lamp-stack, we have used ansible-vault concept. The file 'db_1' has been encypted using vault (vault password: adithya)

# you need to encrypt files which store sensitive data (ex:- db_password)

# commands used to encrypt that file:- (run these commands inside the server)
1) ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/db_1
2) git add .                 # commands 2, 3 & 4 are required because git is considering encryption also as a change because checksum of that file is changing with encryption. (sha1sum <filename>)
3) git commit -m "encrypted db_1 file using ansible-vault"
4) git push origin master     # & pull it to your vscode --> after you pull it to vscode, it will only show encrypted content.
5) ansible-playbook -i hosts-3 lamp.yml --ask-vault-pass

# the main commands are 1) & 5)
# the 5th command will ask for vault pass which is adithya.

# refer blog for few more commands.

# for RedHat, you should start and enable the installed services first. Using Conditionals: -

# - name: start & enable httpd
#      service:
#        name: httpd
#        state: started
#        enabled: true
#    when: ansible_facts['ansible_distribution'] == "RedHat"

# started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.  ************************
