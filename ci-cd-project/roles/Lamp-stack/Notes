# In Lamp-stack, we have used group_vars/all, group_vars/db_1, group_vars/db_2 & hosts-3 files

# In Lamp-stack, we have used ansible-vault concept. The file 'db_1' has been encypted using vault (vault password: adithya)

# you need to encrypt files which store sensitive data (ex:- db_password)

# for RedHat, you should start and enable the installed services first. Using Conditionals: -

# - name: start & enable httpd
#      service:
#        name: httpd
#        state: started
#        enabled: true
#    when: ansible_facts['ansible_distribution'] == "RedHat"

# started/stopped are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.  ************************
