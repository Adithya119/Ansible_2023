By default, Ansible looks for roles in the following locations:

1)    in collections, if you are using them
2)    in a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file
3)    in the configured roles_path. The default search path is ~/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles.
4)    in the directory where the playbook file is located

5) Alternatively, you can call a role with a fully qualified path:-
    ---
    - hosts: webservers
      roles:
      - role: '/path/to/my/roles/common'
    ---


choose either 2) or 4)
